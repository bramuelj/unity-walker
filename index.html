            In the dark of night<br>
            The stars light up the sky<br>
            We see them flying free<br>
            That's just like you and me<br>

            <span class="unity">Everyone is lonely sometimes</span><br>
            But I would walk a thousand miles to see your eyes<br>
            <span class="unity">You are not alone, we are family</span><br>
            Hold me, let's escape all this reality<br>

            <span class="symphony">You are my symphony</span>
            By your side, we are unity<br>
            <span class="energy">You are my energy</span><br>
            My guiding light, we are unity<br>

            <span class="unity">We are unity</span>
            (We are, we are)<br>
            <span class="unity">We are unity</span><br>

            Although the rain might pour<br>
            A thunder starts to roar<br>
            The lightning wakes the wave<br>
            But through it, we are brave<br>

            <span class="unity">Everyone is lonely sometimes</span><br>
            But I would walk a thousand miles to see your eyes<br>
            <span class="unity">You are not alone, we are family</span><br>
            Hold me, let's escape all this reality<br>

            <span class="symphony">You are my symphony</span>
            By your side, we are unity<br>
            <span class="energy">You are my energy</span><br>
            My guiding light, we are unity<br>

            <span class="unity">We are unity</span>
            (We are, we are)<br>
            <span class="unity">We are unity</span><br>

            <span class="symphony">You are my symphony</span> (we are)
            By your side (we are unity)

            My guiding light (we are unity)
